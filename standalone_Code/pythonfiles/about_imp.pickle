S'Forest of Imputation Trees FITs is a method to impute highly sparse and noisy data sets from single cell epigenome profiling. FITs work in two phases. It has been made so to handle very large read-count matrixes and to get better imputation. In phase 1 it builds multiple imputation trees and from every tree it extracts 1 or 2 imputed version of original read count matrix. One can run phase 1 of FITs in parallel processing mode also where multiple trees can be build using several processors. After phase 1 the phase-2 part of FITs is used to accumulate the most relevant imputed version for every cell.\n'
